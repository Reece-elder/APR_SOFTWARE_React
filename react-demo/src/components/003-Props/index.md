# Props / Properties

Within the component Hierarchy Data is *uni Directional* (flows in one direction)
Data flows from parent to child to child etc. 

Data cannot flow up the component tree

Data that does *not change* over the lifetime of an component should be considered a prop (property)

Components that rely on data from a parent should take this as a *prop*
