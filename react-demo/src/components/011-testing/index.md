# Testing with React 

Jest - Java Script + Testing 
A testing software used for a variety of react applications
- Babel, Typescript, node, React and Angular (and others) 

- (Should have) Minimal configuration, it SHOULD work out of the box config free on most JS
- Snapshots take a snapshot of your code, compare it to what is currently there. If not matching test fails
- Fast and efficient - When a Jest test fails, it runs that test first next time 
- Easy Mocking - Jest uses a custom resolver for imports, making it relatively easy to import components/modules
